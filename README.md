# üéôÔ∏è Sentiment Analysis of Voice Input (Real-Time Voice NLP)

This project is a progressive build of a **real-time voice-based emotion and sentiment analysis tool**, inspired by a concept presented during the **LTIMindtree Pre-Placement Talk** at RIT Chennai.

It uses **audio recording**, **speech-to-text**, and **NLP emotion classification** to analyze the emotional tone of spoken input ‚Äî evolving from a basic CLI prototype to an interactive Streamlit app with near real-time analysis.

---

##  Motivation

During LTIMindtree's pre-placement session, the idea of emotion-aware voice interaction systems was introduced. This project brings that concept to life by combining:

-  Voice input
-  Whisper (speech-to-text)
-  Emotion/sentiment detection with Transformers
-  Streamlit-based web UI

##  Project Evolution

| Phase | File        | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
|  Initial | `initial.py` | Terminal-based prototype ‚Äî records 5s audio, transcribes, and analyzes sentiment |
|  Phase 1 | `phase1.py` | Adds browser-based audio recording using Streamlit + basic sentiment output |
|  Phase 2 | `phase2.py` | Improves emotion classification using GoEmotions (`bert-base-go-emotion`) |
|  Final | `app.py` | Splits long recordings into chunks for live-like transcription & multi-label emotion detection |

---

##  Features

-  Record audio from microphone (via browser or system)
-  Transcribe speech using OpenAI's Whisper
-  Detect sentiment/emotions using fine-tuned BERT model
-  Web-based UI (Streamlit)
-  Real-time-ish chunk-wise transcription and analysis
-  No external APIs ‚Äî runs locally using open-source models
